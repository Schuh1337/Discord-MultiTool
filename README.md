> ### üö® Known Issues / "Bugs"

* Message Reacter doesn't work with default Discord Emojis<br>
  ‚Æ°&nbsp;&nbsp; It works if you input the actual emoji, not something like :‚Äãjoy‚Äã:<br>
* DM Channel Clearer only closes DMs with messages in them<br>
  ‚Æ° &nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty sure this is a discord api limitation<br>
